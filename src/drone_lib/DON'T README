LOGS:
/////////////// 26 - 05 -2019 ///////////////
Fixed:
mavros/setpoint_velocity/cmd_vel_unstamped had an extra space, causing failure.
removed function StartDataStream(); set_mode now sends points until enabled, much faster and reliable.
set_position now uses target position, much simpler to use.
